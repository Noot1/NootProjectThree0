# MyFirstApp

 my first app is an Angular application created for a Udacity project, that allows users to view a list of available products to purchase, add them to a shopping cart, and ultimately complete the checkout process.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Project Structure
  - Product list page, which displays the available products for the user to choose and add to their  cart
  - Product details page, which displays more information about any particular product
  - Shopping cart, which includes the products that the user has added to their cart
  - Checkout form, which collects information about the user (e.g., name, address, payment details, etc.)
  - Order confirmation page, which shows the outcome after the user completes the checkout process 
  - data.json. Project fetches product information from this included file to populate the store.
